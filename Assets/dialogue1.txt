I hope I'm not asking for much....
I love humans. 
I wonder if they could see me... if my body was not invisble.. Would they let me be friends with them ?
It's not power, fame, talent, or wealth.. I just want sombody to be by my side.. 
I just want somebody to see me..
I just don't want to be alone anymore... 
As I am walking with my lingering desire for attention, I see a woodcutter from a village caught in a landslide. 
It appears a ginormous boulder has been crushing his legs for days. 
He cannot move.
I must help him
