I feel the evil cleansing away as I suck and trap them into my body. 
My body felt heavy..It feels as if I have materalized in bodily form...
As I walked, the birds flew away.
It did not take a long time for me to realize that I could be seen. 
I was delighted...but also very scared at the same time. 
I could not wait to be friends with humans. 
However, things were different than what I expected. 
People were frightened by the way I looked. And they turned their faces away from me when they saw me. 
My hideousness and darkness were also seeping into my heart........
