Four days have passed.....
The underground water seems be fullfilling the villagers' basic needs.
Their food supply has been replenished. They are drinking healthy water. Skin color returning normal....
However, the feeling inside me.... it is very strange. It feels as if the surface of the problem has been solved, but the root of the disaster has not disappeared. 
The people... they seemed exhausted. 
As I am walking with a very uneasy and unpleasant feeling, I see the ground ahead of me is pitch black. 
It looks like this "blackness" wants to suck me in. An aura of evil engulfs me. This looks like a source of corruption.  
I must eliminate it.
