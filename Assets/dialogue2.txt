I make sure he is able to go back to his home. He was limping a little bit, but the cuts on his legs were shallow. It looks like he will get better in a couple of days. 
Though he was a bit bewildered by how he was able to get out. 
I should be rejoicing at the fact that I saved a human, but I could not. 
The village was devestated by severe drought. As crops died, villagers were starving. Old people died as they were neglected. 
And they drank contaiminated water as survival. 
The stars are nowhere to be seen. 
I must help them.
